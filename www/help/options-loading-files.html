<h1>wmlbrowser options - Tell web sites that the browser understands WML content</h1>
<h2>What's the problem?</h2>

<p>By default, the wmlbrowser extension allows Mozilla/Firefox to load and display WML pages from a web server. But if you have a file on your local disk with a ".wml" extension, your browser doesn't know what to do with it.</p>

<p>If you select this option, Mozilla will know that a .wml file contains WML content and will display it appropriately.</p>

<p><i>Warning: only tested on Windows</i></p>
